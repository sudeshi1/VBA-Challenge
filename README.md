# VBA Challenge: The VBA of Wall Street

## Background
This is a VBA scripting project to analyze real stock market data. The stock data has been categorized yearly, i.e, *2014, 2015, 2016* in different sheets.

## Accomplishments
[Stocks](/stocks.bas)

Create a script that looped through all the stocks for one worksheet and resulted with the following information:
1. Displaying the **ticker symbol** in *column I*.
2. The script then looped through all the stocks to result in **total stocks volume** in *column L*. 
3. Created a script to give an output for **yearly change** from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in *column J*
   
   **Yearly Price = Close Price - Open Price** of each given stock
   
4. Lastly, generated a script to give an output for the **percent change** from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year in *column K*

   **Percent Change = (Yearly Price/Open Price)** of each given stock
   
5. Applied conditional formatting that highlighted *positive* yearly change in **green** and *negative* yearly change in **red**.

## Bonus!

6. Created a script in order to display, **Greatest Percent Increase*, **Greatest Percent Decrease** and **Greatest Total Volume** with their corresponding ticker names and values for the yearly stocks.
7. Finally, made appropriate adjustments to the script that allowed it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year just by running the script **once**.
